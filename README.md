**ng-suggest** is a module for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) to facilitate 
the use of [OpenSearch Suggestions](http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Suggestions/1.0) and [SeeAlso links](http://www.gbv.de/wikis/cls/SeeAlso) in web application.

## Install

### npm

```bash
npm install ng-suggest --safe
```

### bower

```

## Usage

See <https://gbv.github.io/ng-suggest/> for documentation and usage examples!

## Customization

To support APIs that do not strictly follow OpenSearch Suggest specification, the
{@link ng-suggest.service:OpenSearchSuggestions OpenSearchSuggestions} service
can be customized with a transformation function. The 
{@link ng-suggest.directive:suggest-typeahead suggest-typeahead} directive contains
a default template that can be replaced or styled with CSS.
